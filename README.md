# Ecosystem
James Li

I intended to make my ecosystem wildlife themed and chose the African safari. My animals are a warthog, hyena, and beetle and I specifically chose them to represent omnivores, predators, and decomposers. I believed that choosing this variety would naturally make the ecosystem self-balance. I also added a tunnel resource in addition to food to create an interesting hide/run mechanic between the warthog and the hyenas. To complicate this more, I made it so the beetles can destroy and create tunnels so that the playing ground for hyenas chasing warthogs would be more even. I learned how to make a state machine in scripts as well as how to use collisions to make the animals interact with each other. I also learned about animation layers so I could layer my damage animation ontop of the current action animation of the animals. I think my code was really messy since I didn't know how to use OOP in Unity before I created my scripts. I made a bad decision to continue to script without OOP and it made the code very messy. I think I will try to plan my code out better the next time. I also tried going back to 2D art for my sprites, which I think was a mistake. My artworks didn't feel like they hit as well as I wanted them to.
